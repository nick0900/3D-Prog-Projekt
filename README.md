# My First Rendering Engine
![alt text](presentation/galaxy%20wide.gif)
## Overview
Project made for a course of 3D-programming using DirectX 11. Various features developed by myself over a 6 months period in 2022. Developed in c++, most easily opened and compiled with visual studio.

Use wasd for movement and arrows for pivoting the camera.

## Features
The course assignment required various features to be implemented. Each feature is explained and presented below.

### Custom OBJ Importer

### Phong Lighting

### Shadow Maps

### Deferred Rendering

### Quad-Tree Culling

### Tesselation

### Mirror Reflections

## Issues
Can only seem to run in debug mode. Don't remember if that was an issue when I made the project originally. 

Models using Tesselation or Reflection seem to be broken. Know for a fact they did work when I first made the project. Possible I have just forgotten how to enable it properly, revisiting old code can prove to be quite the enigma.
